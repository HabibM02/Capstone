# Canadian Federal Election Trends
The aim of this capstone project to try to foresee and analyze any trends in future Canadian federal elections based on historical data. I have elected to work with the datasets from the last 8 federal election cycles; all available publicly via Elections Canada. These datasets provide the following for each riding across the country: a) the winning candidate and the associated party, b) total number of votes cast, c) number of votes cast for the winning candidate, among other attributes.
